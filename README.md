# UROPS-TCGA-Analysis

This analysis was done for my UROPS (ZB3288), a semester long Systems Biology project on cancer gene expression. RTCGA.R downloads, cleans and plots survival curves against various expression levels of PTEN and WDR48, thought to contribute to breast cancer. OmniPath.R elucidates and represents potential interacting genes of PTEN and WDR48 in a graph network. Cancerstage.R downloads and represents expression data of PTEN and WDR48 against cancer stage.
